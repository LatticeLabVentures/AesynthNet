Aeternity Protocol for Artificial Asset Exchange in the Cryptoeconomic Coherence of Money Markets and Monetary Models.

# Application Context

A ‘synthetic asset’ is a simulation of a real world asset.  It is a synthetic representation of a real or collection of assets.  It also represents/holds the same financial value of the asset(s) it represents. It can be a combination of  derivatives like futures, options or swaps. The underlying asset of the derivatives could  be a stock, bond, commodity, currency etc. Future and forward contracts are contracts that are used by businesses and investors to hedge against risks or speculate. 

Futures and forwards are examples of derivative assets that derive their values from underlying assets. Both contracts rely on locking in a specific price for a certain asset.

There are many different reasons behind the creation of synthetic positions. A synthetic position, for example, may be undertaken to create the same payoff as a financial instrument using other financial instruments. A trader may choose to create a synthetic short position using options as it is easier than borrowing stock and selling it short. This also applies to long positions, as traders can mimic a long position in a stock using options without having to lay out the capital to actually purchase the stock.

This application is a novel implementation of time locked, mixed oracle powered derivative contracts first ever implementation in the Aeternity Protocol.
